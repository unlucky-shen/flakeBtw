# FlakeBtw ❄️

My attempt on making a "minimal"-ish NixOS flake. Still a work in progress...

Experience has been FLAWLESS on NixOS so far, best distro ong T_T

### Installation

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unlucky-shen/.FlakeBtw/main/install.sh > install.sh

chmod +x ./install.sh

./install.sh
```

### Add to steam launch options
```
nvidia-offload %command%
```

### Currently working on...

- [x] Porting my neovim lua config to nix
- [x] Modularize NixOS
- [ ] Making entire system "declarative"
- [ ] Fixed borked install script T_T
