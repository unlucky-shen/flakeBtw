# FlakeBtw ❄️

My attempt on making a "minimal"-ish NixOS flake. Still a work in progress...

### Installation

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unlucky-shen/.FlakeBtw/main/install.sh > install.sh

chmod +x ./install.sh

./install.sh
```

### Steam Launch Options
```
nvidia-offload gamemoderun gamescope -w 1920 -h 1080 -- %command%
```

### Currently working on...

- [x] Porting my neovim lua config to nix
- [x] Modularize NixOS
- [ ] Making entire system "declarative"
